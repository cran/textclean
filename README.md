Installation
============

To download the development version of **textclean**:

Download the [zip
ball](https://github.com/trinker/textclean/zipball/master) or [tar
ball](https://github.com/trinker/textclean/tarball/master), decompress
and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it, or use the **pacman** package to install
the development version:

    if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
    pacman::p_load_gh(
        "trinker/lexicon",    
        "trinker/textclean"
    )

Load the Packages/Data
----------------------

    if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
    pacman::p_load(dplyr)
    pacman::p_load_gh("trinker/textshape", "trinker/lexicon", "trinker/textclean")

Check Text
----------

One of the most useful tools in **textclean** is `check_text` which
scans text variables and reports potential problems. Not all potential
problems are definite problems for analysis but the report provides an
overview of what may need further preparation. The report also provides
suggested functions for the reported problems. The report provides
information on the following:

1.  **non\_character** - Text that is `factor`.
2.  **missing\_ending\_punctuation** - Text with no endmark at the end
    of the string.
3.  **empty** - Text that contains an empty element (i.e., `""`).
4.  **double\_punctuation** - Text that contains two punctuation marks
    in the same string.
5.  **non\_space\_after\_comma** - Text that contains commas with no
    space after them.
6.  **no\_alpha** - Text that contains string elements with no
    alphabetic characters.
7.  **non\_ascii** - Text that contains non-ASCII characters.
8.  **missing\_value** - Text that contains missing values (i.e., `NA`).
9.  **containing\_escaped** - Text that contains escaped (see
    `?Quotes`).
10. **containing\_digits** - Text that contains digits.
11. **indicating\_incomplete** - Text that contains endmarks that are
    indicative of incomplete/trailing sentences (e.g., `...`).
12. **potentially\_misspelled** - Text that contains potentially
    misspelled words.

Here is an example:

    x <- c("i like", "i want. thet them ther .", "I am ! that|", "", NA, 
        "they,were there", ".", "   ", "?", "3;", "I like goud eggs!", 
        "bi\xdfchen Z\xfcrcher", "i 4like...", "\\tgreat",  "She said \"yes\"")
    Encoding(x) <- "latin1"
    x <- as.factor(x)
    check_text(x)

Row Filtering
-------------

It is useful to filter/remove empty rows or unwanted rows (for example
the researcher dialogue from a transcript). The `filter_empty_row` &
`filter_row` do empty row do just this. First I'll demo the removal of
empty rows.

    ## create a data set wit empty rows
    (dat <- rbind.data.frame(DATA[, c(1, 4)], matrix(rep(" ", 4), 
        ncol =2, dimnames=list(12:13, colnames(DATA)[c(1, 4)]))))

    ##        person                                 state
    ## 1         sam         Computer is fun. Not too fun.
    ## 2        greg               No it's not, it's dumb.
    ## 3     teacher                    What should we do?
    ## 4         sam                  You liar, it stinks!
    ## 5        greg               I am telling the truth!
    ## 6       sally                How can we be certain?
    ## 7        greg                      There is no way.
    ## 8         sam                       I distrust you.
    ## 9       sally           What are you talking about?
    ## 10 researcher         Shall we move on?  Good then.
    ## 11       greg I'm hungry.  Let's eat.  You already?
    ## 12                                                 
    ## 13

    filter_empty_row(dat)

    ##        person                                 state

    ## 7        greg                      There is no way.

Next we filter out rows. The `filter_row` function takes a data set, a
column (named or numeric position) and regex terms to search for. The
`terms` argument takes regex(es) allowing for partial matching. `terms`
is case sensitive but can be changed via the `ignore.case` argument.

    filter_row(dataframe = DATA, column = "person", terms = c("sam", "greg"))

Stripping
---------

Often it is useful to remove all non relevant symbols and case from a
text (letters, spaces, and apostrophes are retained). The `strip`
function accomplishes this. The `char.keep` argument allows the user to
retain characters.

    strip(DATA$state)

    ##  [1] "computer is fun not too fun"      "no it's not it's dumb"           
    ##  [3] "what should we do"                "you liar it stinks"              
    ##  [5] "i am telling the truth"           "how can we be certain"           
    ##  [7] "there is no way"                  "i distrust you"                  
    ##  [9] "what are you talking about"       "shall we move on good then"      
    ## [11] "i'm hungry let's eat you already"

    strip(DATA$state, apostrophe.remove = TRUE)

    ##  [1] "computer is fun not too fun"    "no its not its dumb"           
    ##  [3] "what should we do"              "you liar it stinks"            
    ##  [5] "i am telling the truth"         "how can we be certain"         
    ##  [7] "there is no way"                "i distrust you"                
    ##  [9] "what are you talking about"     "shall we move on good then"    
    ## [11] "im hungry lets eat you already"

    strip(DATA$state, char.keep = c("?", "."))

    ##  [1] "computer is fun. not too fun."      
    ##  [2] "no it's not it's dumb."             
    ##  [3] "what should we do?"                 
    ##  [4] "you liar it stinks"                 
    ##  [5] "i am telling the truth"             
    ##  [6] "how can we be certain?"             
    ##  [7] "there is no way."                   
    ##  [8] "i distrust you."                    
    ##  [9] "what are you talking about?"        
    ## [10] "shall we move on? good then."       
    ## [11] "i'm hungry. let's eat. you already?"

Subbing
-------

### Multiple Subs

`gsub` is a great tool but often the user wants to replace a vector of
elements with another vector. `mgsub` allows for a vector of patterns
and replacements. Note that the first argument of `mgsub` is the data,
not the `pattern` as is standard with base R's `gsub`. This allows
`mgsub` to be used in a **magrittr** pipeline more easily. Also note
that by default `fixed = TRUE`. This means the search `pattern` is not a
regex per-se. This makes the replacement much faster when a regex search
is not needed. `mgsub` also reorders the patterns to ensure patterns
contained within patterns don't over write the longer pattern. For
example if the pattern `c('i', 'it')` is given the longer `'it'` is
replaced first (though `order.pattern = FALSE` can be used to negate
this feature).

    mgsub(DATA$state, c("it's", "I'm"), c("<<it is>>", "<<I am>>"))

    ##  [1] "Computer is fun. Not too fun."           
    ##  [2] "No <<it is>> not, <<it is>> dumb."       
    ##  [3] "What should we do?"                      
    ##  [4] "You liar, it stinks!"                    
    ##  [5] "I am telling the truth!"                 
    ##  [6] "How can we be certain?"                  
    ##  [7] "There is no way."                        
    ##  [8] "I distrust you."                         
    ##  [9] "What are you talking about?"             
    ## [10] "Shall we move on? Good then."            
    ## [11] "<<I am>> hungry. Let's eat. You already?"

    mgsub(DATA$state, "[[:punct:]]", "<<PUNCT>>", fixed = FALSE)

    ##  [1] "Computer is fun<<PUNCT>> Not too fun<<PUNCT>>"

    mgsub(DATA$state, c("i", "it"), c("<<I>>", "[[IT]]"))

    ## [11] "I'm hungry. Let's eat. You already?"

    mgsub(DATA$state, c("i", "it"), c("<<I>>", "[[IT]]"), order.pattern = FALSE)

    ## [10] "Shall we move on? Good then."       
    ## [11] "I'm hungry. Let's eat. You already?"

### Stashing Character Pre-Sub

There are times the user may want to stash a set of characters before
subbing out and then return the stashed characters. An example of this
is when a researcher wants to remove punctuation but not emoticons. The
`subholder` function provides tooling to stash the emoticons, allow a
punctuation stripping, and then return the emoticons. First I'll create
some fake text data with emoticons, then stash the emoticons (using a
unique text key to hold their place), then I'll strip out the
punctuation, and last put the stashed emoticons back.

    (fake_dat <- paste(hash_emoticons[1:11, 1, with=FALSE][[1]], DATA$state))

    ##  [1] "#-o Computer is fun. Not too fun."        
    ##  [2] "$_$ No it's not, it's dumb."              
    ##  [3] "(*v*) What should we do?"                 
    ##  [4] "(-: You liar, it stinks!"                 
    ##  [5] "(-}{-) I am telling the truth!"           
    ##  [6] "(.V.) How can we be certain?"             
    ##  [7] ")-: There is no way."                     
    ##  [8] "*-* I distrust you."                      
    ##  [9] "*<:o) What are you talking about?"        
    ## [10] "//_^ Shall we move on?  Good then."       
    ## [11] "0;) I'm hungry.  Let's eat.  You already?"

    (m <- sub_holder(fake_dat, hash_emoticons[[1]]))

    ##  [1] "zzzplaceholderazzz Computer is fun. Not too fun."      
    ##  [2] "zzzplaceholderbzzz No it's not, it's dumb."

Replacement
-----------

**textclean** contains tools to replace substrings within text with
other substrings that may be easier to analyze. This section outlines
the uses of these tools.

### Contractions

Some analysis techniques require contractions to be replaced with their
multi-word forms (e.g., "I'll" -&gt; "I will"). `replace_contrction`
provides this functionality.

    x <- c("Mr. Jones isn't going.",  
        "Check it out what's going on.",
        "He's here but didn't go.",
        "the robot at t.s. wasn't nice", 
        "he'd like it if i'd go away")

    replace_contraction(x)

    ## [1] "Mr. Jones is not going."            
    ## [2] "Check it out what is going on."     
    ## [3] "he is here but did not go."         
    ## [4] "the robot at t.s. was not nice"     
    ## [5] "he would like it if I would go away"

### Emoticons

Some analysis techniques examine words, meaning emoticons may be
ignored. `replace_emoticons` replaces emoticons with their word forms
equivalents.

    x <- c(
        "text from: http://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/textmessageabbreviations_02.asp",
        "... understanding what different characters used in smiley faces mean:",
        "The close bracket represents a sideways smile  )",
        "Add in the colon and you have sideways eyes   :",
        "Put them together to make a smiley face  :)",
        "Use the dash -  to add a nose   :-)",
        "Change the colon to a semi-colon ; and you have a winking face ;)  with a nose  ;-)",
        "Put a zero 0 (halo) on top and now you have a winking, smiling angel 0;) with a nose 0;-)",
        "Use the letter 8 in place of the colon for sunglasses 8-)",
        "Use the open bracket ( to turn the smile into a frown  :-("
    )

    replace_emoticon(x)

    ##  [1] "text from: http://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/textmessageabbreviations_02.asp"                
    ##  [2] "... understanding what different characters used in smiley faces mean:"                       
    ##  [3] "The close bracket represents a sideways smile )"                                              
    ##  [4] "Add in the colon and you have sideways eyes :"                                                
    ##  [5] "Put them together to make a smiley face happy "                                               
    ##  [6] "Use the dash - to add a nose happy "                                                          
    ##  [7] "Change the colon to a semi-colon ; and you have a winking face winking with a nose winking "  
    ##  [8] "Put a zero 0 (halo) on top and now you have a winking, smiling angel angel with a nose angel "
    ##  [9] "Use the letter 8 in place of the colon for sunglasses glasses "                               
    ## [10] "Use the open bracket ( to turn the smile into a frown sad "

### Grades

In analysis where grades may be discussed it may be useful to convert
the letter forms into word meanings. The `replace_grade` can be used for
this task.

    text <- c(
        "I give an A+",
        "He deserves an F",
        "It's C+ work",
        "A poor example deserves a C!"
    )
    replace_grade(text)

    ## [1] "I give an very excellent excellent+"                                     
    ## [2] "He deserves an very bad"                                                 
    ## [3] "It's slightly above average+ work"                                       
    ## [4] "very excellent excellent poor example deserves a slightly above average!"

### HTML

Sometimes HTML tags and symbols stick around like pesky gnats. The
`replace_html` function makes light work of them.

    x <- c(
        "<bold>Random</bold> text with symbols: &nbsp; &lt; &gt; &amp; &quot; &apos;",
        "<p>More text</p> &cent; &pound; &yen; &euro; &copy; &reg;"
    )

    replace_html(x)

    ## [1] "Random text with symbols: < > & \" '"   
    ## [2] "More text cents pounds yen euro (c) (r)"

### Incomplete Sentences

Sometimes an incomplete sentence is denoted with multiple end marks or
no punctuation at all. `replace_incomplete` standardizes these sentences
with a pipe (`|`) endmark (or one of the user's choice).

    x <- c("the...",  "I.?", "you.", "threw..", "we?")
    replace_incomplete(x)

    ## [1] "the|"   "I|"     "you."   "threw|" "we?"

    replace_incomplete(x, '...')

    ## [1] "the..."   "I..."     "you."     "threw..." "we?"

### Non-ASCII Characters

R can choke on non-ASCII characters. They can be re-encoded but the new
encoding may lack interpretability (e.g., ¢ may be converted to `\xA2`
which is not easily understood or likely to be matched in a hash look
up). `replace_non_ascii` attempts to replace common non-ASCII characters
with a text representation (e.g., ¢ becomes "cent") Non recognized
non-ASCII characters are simply removed (unless
`remove.nonconverted = FALSE`).

    x <- c(
        "Hello World", "6 Ekstr\xf8m", "J\xf6reskog", "bi\xdfchen Z\xfcrcher",
        'This is a \xA9 but not a \xAE', '6 \xF7 2 = 3', 'fractions \xBC, \xBD, \xBE',
        'cows go \xB5', '30\xA2'
    )
    Encoding(x) <- "latin1"
    x

    ## [7] "fractions ¼, ½, ¾"       "cows go µ"              
    ## [9] "30¢"

### Numbers

Some analysis requires numbers to be converted to text form.
`replace_number` attempts to perform this task. `replace_number` handles
comma separated numbers as well.

    x <- c("I like 346,457 ice cream cones.", "They are 99 percent good")
    y <- c("I like 346457 ice cream cones.", "They are 99 percent good")
    replace_number(x)

    ## [1] "I like three hundred forty six thousand four hundred fifty seven ice cream cones."
    ## [2] "They are ninety nine percent good"

    replace_number(y)

    ## [1] "I like three hundred forty six thousand four hundred fifty seven ice cream cones."
    ## [2] "They are ninety nine percent good"

    replace_number(x, num.paste = TRUE)

    ## [1] "I like threehundredfortysixthousandfourhundredfiftyseven ice cream cones."
    ## [2] "They are ninetynine percent good"

    replace_number(x, remove=TRUE)

    ## [1] "I like  ice cream cones." "They are  percent good"

### Ratings

Some texts use ratings to convey satisfaction with a particular object.
The `replace_rating` function replaces the more abstract rating with
word equivalents.

    x <- c("This place receives 5 stars for their APPETIZERS!!!",
         "Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe!",
         "10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.",
         "* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!",
         "For service, I give them no stars.", "This place deserves no stars.",
         "10 out of 10 stars.",
         "My rating: just 3 out of 10.",
         "If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.",
         "Rating: 1 out of 10.",
         "I gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality.",
         "If it were possible to give them 0/10, they'd have it."
    )

    replace_rating(x)

    ##  [1] "This place receives best for their APPETIZERS!!!"                    
    ##  [2] " better for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe!"
    ##  [3] " best for both the movie and trilogy."                               
    ##  [4] "* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely best !" 
    ##  [5] "For service, I give them terrible ."                                 
    ##  [6] "This place deserves terrible ."                                      
    ##  [7] " best stars."                                                        
    ##  [8] "My rating: just below average ."                                     
    ##  [9] "If there were terrible I would give it terrible ."                   
    ## [10] "Rating: extremely below average ."                                   
    ## [11] "I gave it best because of the sound quality."                        
    ## [12] "If it were possible to give them terrible , they'd have it."

### Ordinal Numbers

Again, some analysis requires numbers, including ordinal numbers, to be
converted to text form. `replace_ordinal` attempts to perform this task
for ordinal number 1-100 (i.e., 1st - 100th).

    x <- c(
        "I like the 1st one not the 22nd one.", 
        "For the 100th time stop those 3 things!",
        "I like the 3rd 1 not the 12th 1."
    )
    replace_ordinal(x)

    ## [1] "I like the first one not the twenty second one."
    ## [2] "For the hundredth time stop those 3 things!"    
    ## [3] "I like the third 1 not the twelfth 1."

    replace_ordinal(x, TRUE)

    ## [1] "I like the first one not the twentysecond one."
    ## [2] "For the hundredth time stop those 3 things!"   
    ## [3] "I like the third 1 not the twelfth 1."

    replace_ordinal(x, remove = TRUE)

    ## [1] "I like the one not the one."       "For the time stop those 3 things!"
    ## [3] "I like the 1 not the 1."

    replace_number(replace_ordinal(x))

    ## [1] "I like the first one not the twenty second one."
    ## [2] "For the hundredth time stop those three things!"
    ## [3] "I like the third one not the twelfth one."

### Symbols

Text often contains short-hand representations of words/phrases. These
symbols may contain analyzable information but in the symbolic form they
cannot be parsed. The `replace_symbol` function attempts to replace the
symbols `c("$", "%", "#", "@", "& "w/")` with their word equivalents.

    x <- c("I am @ Jon's & Jim's w/ Marry", 
        "I owe $41 for food", 
        "two is 10% of a #"
    )
    replace_symbol(x)

    ## [1] "I am at Jon's and Jim's with Marry"
    ## [2] "I owe dollar 41 for food"          
    ## [3] "two is 10 percent of a number"

### White Space

Regex white space characters (e.g., `\n`, `\t`, `\r`) matched by `\s`
may impede analysis. These can be replaced with a single space `" "` via
the `replace_white` function.

    x <- "I go \r
        to   the \tnext line"
    x

    ## [1] "I go \r\n    to   the \tnext line"

    cat(x)

    ## I go 
    ##     to   the     next line

    replace_white(x)

    ## [1] "I go to the next line"
